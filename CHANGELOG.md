# Change Log

# [2.0.1]

## Fixed
- `zet -c`, like `zet --count`, is supposed to count the number of times a line appears unless there's a `--files` flag; but due to an error, `-c` always counts the number of files the line appears in. (So if a line appears in one file 100 times, the reported count is 1, even without the `--file` flag.)  This is fixed, but since it changes behaviour in a non-backward compatible way, we bump the major version number.

## Changed
- Bump Minimum Supported Rust Version to 1.78.0

# [1.0.0] - 2023-04-18

## Added
- Add the `--count-lines` flag to show the number of times each line occurs in the input and the `--count-files` flag to show the number of files each line occurs in.  The `--count` flag acts like `--count-lines` unless `--count-files` is active, in which case it acts like `--count-files`. The `--count-none` flag turns off counting, and can be used to override the other `count` flags. (In the usual POSIX convention, the last `count` flag given will override any previous `count` flag.)

## Changed
- **Breaking:** When `-` is used as a file argument, `zet` reads from standard input, not the file `-` in the current directory.  (That file can be passed to `zet` as `./-`)
- When no file arguments are given, `zet` reads from standard input.
- **Breaking:** Add the `--files` (alias `--file`) flag for the `zet single` and `zet multiple` commands. The `zet single` command now outputs lines that occur exactly once in the entire input. The `zet single --file` command reproduces the old behavior (output lines that occur in just one file, though possibly many times in that one file). Similarly, `zet multiple --files` reproduces the old behavior of requiring output lines to occur in more than one file, while `zet multiple` without the `--files` flag will output lines that occur more than once, even if in just one file.
- Use `clap 4`'s help format, but `clap 3`'s colors. This is self-indulgent recreation of (part of) clap's `help` feature, because I like the `clap 4`'s help format, but really miss the colored (rather than gray-scale) help.

# [0.2.6] - 2023-02-02

## Removed
- Abandon trying to have a Minimum Supported Rust Version (maybe once we're 1.0?)

## Changed
- Use cargo-dist to create the release
- Move `for_byte_lines` from `NextOperand` to a trait (thanks to [ysthakur] for the suggestion)

## [0.2.5] - 2022-11-10

## Changed
- Bump Minimum Supported Rust Version to 1.64.0
- Switch from `failure` to `anyhow`
- Performance enhancements:
    - Use `Cow` keys for `UnionSet` and `CountedSet` so we can borrow the lines of
      the first file rather than allocating them
    - If `line` is in a `CountedSet`, don't allocate a key
    - Use `FxHash` â€” averages 10-15% faster on large files
    - Convert `Diff` and `Union` to use `CowSet`
    - Convert `Single`, `Multiple`, and `Intersect` to by-line algorithms
    - No longer create map/set for args after the 1st
- Refactor and expand internal documentation.
- Change Single/Multiple code to use a single NonZeroUsize operand ID rather than
  two u32 IDs

# [0.2.0] - 2021-07-03

## Changed
- Zet looks for Byte Order Marks in UTF-8, UTF-16LE and UTF-16BE files,
  translating UTF-16LE and UTF-16BE to UTF-8. It outputs a (UTF-8) Byte Order
  Mark if and only if it finds one in its first file argument.
- Zet strips off the line terminator (`\n` or `\r\n`) from each input line. On
  output, it uses the line terminator found in the first line of its first file
  argument (or `\n` if the first file consists of a single line with no
  terminator).

# [0.1.1] - 2021-06-14

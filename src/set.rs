/// A `ZetSet` is a set of lines, each line represented as a key of an `IndexMap`.
/// * Keys are `Cow<'data, [u8]>`
/// * Lines inserted from the first file operand are represented as `Cow::Borrowed` keys
/// * Lines inserted from the second and following files are represented as `Cow::Owned` keys
/// * Each set operation (`Union`, `Diff`, etc) associates a small bookkeeping value
///   with each key. The value type differs from operation to operation, and by whether we're
///   counting the number of times each line appears, or the number of files in which each
///   lines appears (or if we're not counting either).
/// * A `ZetSet` also keeps information about whether the first file operand began with
///   a Unicode Byte Order Mark, and what line terminator was used on the first line of
///   the first file. On output, the `ZetSet` will print a Byte Order Mark if the first
///   file operand had one, and will use the same line terminator as that file's first
///   line.
